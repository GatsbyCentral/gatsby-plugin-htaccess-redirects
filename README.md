htaccess Redirects in Gatsby
---

If you want to host your Gatsby output with Apache, you can use a `.htaccess`
file to have redirects processed server side. This plugin builds that file for
you.

NOTE: It's currently untested (although expected to work) with a `pathPrefix`.
Please let us know in an issue if you test this and it works (or doesn't).
